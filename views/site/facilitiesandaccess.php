                     We endeavour to see all patients and have a fully equipped downstairs surgery and a toilet both with wheelchair access.  There is a small step up at the front door which most wheenchair users can use but we do have a portable ramp which can be placed if this is a problem.  If you have any disability that you think we need to know about please give us a call before your appointment and we will do our best to put suitable arrangements in place.
